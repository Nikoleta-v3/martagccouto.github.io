Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://fp-santos.github.io/lab/">Prosocial Dynamics Lab</a>, at the <a href="https://www.sias-uva.nl">Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems Group</a>, at the University of Amsterdam. I work on mathematical models based on evolutionary concepts and game theory to understand social behaviour, such as how individuals learn to cooperate.

In my postdoc, I am working on the “Algorithmic Fairness and Accuracy in Adaptive Populations” project in collaboration with ING Analytics. We explore the population dynamics of strategic individuals adapting to classification algorithms.
