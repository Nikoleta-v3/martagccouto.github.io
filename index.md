Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://fp-santos.github.io/lab/">Prosocial Dynamics Lab</a>, at the <a href="https://www.sias-uva.nl">Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems Group</a>, at the University of Amsterdam.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I develop mathematical models inspired by evolutionary principles and game theory to understand social behavior, like how individuals learn to cooperate and coordinate.
I am particularly interested on asymmetric games, where the interacting players are unequal.
For instance, they can differ in their strategic motivations or in the way they learn behaviors.

Currently, I am working on Algorithmic Fairness and Accuracy in Adaptive Populations, a project in collaboration with ING Analytics. 
We explore the population dynamics of strategic individuals adapting to classification algorithms.

I completed my PhD in 2024 at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology at the <a href="http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/">Research Group Dynamics of Social Behavior</a>.
